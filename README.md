## V1.0 - What We Learned

* Defining the product through Use Cases
  * Using Use Cases we were able to define a clear path as to our end goal, with clear and obvious milestones.
* Pair Programming
  * The project was built by having one person write the code, while the other observed and commented. This allowed the two of us to gain a firm grasp on each other's programming techniques and ideas, and to learn from each other.
  * The use of pair programming and use cases allowed both of us to have the same mental model of the end product during the entirety of the development cycle.
* Using Trello
  * Trello allowed us to visually track our progress, and see consistent progress along our path.
* Structuring Data
  * It's better to plan the structure of your data and the flow through your program before beginning development.
* Using Core Data
  * Learned that Core Data is the primary access into the model layer of the program.

* Things to Change
  * Having a set schedule for work would improve time to production and consistency in development.
  * Use a user story map to collect desired features and fine tune them into a final product.
